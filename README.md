# Contacts Management System


**Project Description**

The Contacts Management System is a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) feature that allows users to manage contacts. It provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, using React and MUI components for the frontend and Node.js with Express and MongoDB for the backend. Users can add, view, edit, and delete contact details, with the ability to paginate, sort, and validate form inputs.

**Technical Decisions and Overview**

* Frontend: Built with React.js and MUI (Material-UI) components, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface.
* Backend: Developed using Node.js and Express to serve RESTful APIs, connecting with a MongoDB database to store and manage contact details.
* Pagination & Sorting: The application uses TablePagination and TableSortLabel components to enable easy navigation and sorting of contacts.
* Form Validation: Included to ensure the data integrity of user inputs, especially for email and phone fields.
* Error Handling: Robust error handling for both client-side (frontend validations) and server-side (API error responses).
* Database: MongoDB is used for its scalability, flexibility, and seamless integration with Node.js for handling large amounts of data.
